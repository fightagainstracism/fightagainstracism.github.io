			<br>
			<p>Every 1 in 1000 black men is expected to be killed by police. This risk peaks between the age of 20-35. Black women and men, and American Indian, as well as Alaska Native women are significantly more likely to be killed than whites. Latino men are also more likely to be killed than white men. Research has proven ace, age and gender play a role in determining criminal justice.</p>
			<p>Police violence is leading the cause of death for young men in the US.
				This has started the movement <span>BLACK LIVES MATTER </span>to fight for black people’s rights all over the world.</p>

			<p>Racism around the world has always been an issue, and it is well discussed and talked about, but a lot of people
				do not realise that it can occur within one race group.</p>
			<p>Colourism, or what BBC calls "discrimation against dark-skinned people in favour of those with lighter skin
			   of the same race" - has been receiving increasing attention, raising questions on why black and Asian people in the
			 public eye often have lighter skin.</p>

      		<br>
			<p>While assumptions and stereotypes about white people do exist, this is considered racial prejudice, not racism.</p>
      		<p> Racial prejudice refers to a set of discriminatory or derogatory attitudes based on assumptions derived from perceptions about race and/or skin colour. Thus, racial prejudice can indeed be directed at white people (e.g., “White people can’t dance”) but is not considered racism because of the systemic relationship to power.</p>
      		<p>When backed with power, prejudice results in acts of discrimination and oppression against groups or individuals. In Canada, white people hold this cultural power due to Eurocentric modes of thinking, rooted in colonialism, that continue to reproduce and privilege whiteness. It is whiteness that has the power to define the terms of racialized others’ existence.</p>

      		<br>
			<p>The Stop Asian Hate fight against racism has been gaining traction, and for good measure too.</p>
      <p>Ever since it came to light that the COVID-19 virus originated in Wuhan, China, incidents of hate against Asians in America have been steadily on the rise. According to a study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, there has been an increase of 150 percent in hate crimes against Asians in the US in 2020 — more than double of 2019. These include attacks on people of Asian origin as well as the businesses run by them. The study found that two of the cities, where Asians have been targeted the most are Los Angeles and New York.</p>
			<p>People have been highlighting these hate crime incidents on social media, raising awareness and asking everyone to look out for their Asian American family, friends and neighbours. Thousands took to the streets in New York, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Washington and even Montreal in Canada in the last few days speaking out against anti-Asian hate, calling for police reforms and criticising Trump for his hateful rhetoric against China during the pandemic.</p>

      		<br>
			<p>Racial discrimination at workplace involves treating someone an applicant or employee unfavorably because he/she is of a certain race or because of personal characteristics associated with race such as hair texture, skin color, or certain facial features.</p>
      		<p>Racial discrimination at workplace can occur directly for example employee A from minority race got rejected for an interview while employee B from majority race with the same skills and experience are hired.</p>
			<p>It can also occur indirectly for example when the job requirement include fluent in certain language most of the time, the interviewer will favor the employee from the race associated with the language.</p>
